# OOPCourse_Arkonid
This is a minimal version of the classic arkonid game written in Java using OOP principles.

This project took place in an OOP course on my first year of my first CS-degree.

The code is the logic of the game, the GUI package supplied by our course staff. 

## Description
This game includes 4 levels and the player have 1 live.

Before each level there is a counter which is count down from 3.

**The rules** are like the classic arkonid game- 

The ball bounce on the paddle and hits blocks, in every hit the block removed.

You win a level if you removed all the blockes.

For eack block the player manage to remove he gets 5 points and for the first block in level 1 is 105 points.

The game have a WINNER screen, a LOSER screen and a PAUSE screen.
